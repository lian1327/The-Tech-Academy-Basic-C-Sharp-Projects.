Create a list of strings that has at least two identical strings in the list.

Create a foreach loop that evaluates each item in the list, and displays a message showing the string and whether or not it has already appeared in the list. For example, if you had a list of letters: {“A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “C”}, you could have the following print to the screen:

A - this item is unique
B - this item is unique
C - this item is unique
D - this item is unique
C - this item is a duplicate
